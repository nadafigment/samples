Some of Dave's sample code.

Still in the early days of this repository, but starting to flesh this
out with some samples of my work. Hopefully it gives you an idea of my
style and how i write code.

Right now it's a mix of python and C++ -- separate dirs for different
languages underneath top-level topic dirs. python should run with
python 2.5+, and probably works with 3 but i haven't tested. C++ projects
should work with most any compiler, and have (minimal) cmake setups.
