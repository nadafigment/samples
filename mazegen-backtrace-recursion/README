See http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking
for a nice overview.

Hereâ€™s the mile-high view of recursive backtracking:

Choose a starting point in the field.

Randomly choose a wall at that point and carve a passage through to
the adjacent cell, but only if the adjacent cell has not been visited
yet. This becomes the new current cell.

If all adjacent cells have been visited, back up to the last cell that
has uncarved walls and repeat.

The algorithm ends when the process has backed all the way up to the
starting point.
